# Complex_Alpha-Numeric_Generator
Complex Alphabetic or Numeric and AlphaNumeric Generator (CANG) : Generate key string Randomly or Sequentially by the ID or the string.
I have combined two working scripts to make this nice CANG.<br />
from :<br />
https://github.com/admiyn/sequential-alphanumeric-generator/blob/master/alphanumeric-generator.php<br />
and<br />
https://github.com/loader/kvzlib/blob/master/php/functions/alphaID.inc.php<br />
Just want to say a thanks to these two guys that they make me understand how to generate a key string for my generator.
And ofcourse a one thanks belonging to users which were helping me to understand at this czech website :<br />
